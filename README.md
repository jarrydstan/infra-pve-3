# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Project

Welcome to my Infrastructure as Code (IaC) project! This repository is dedicated to converting and managing my entire infrastructure through code, enabling consistent, scalable, and version-controlled infrastructure management.

## üéØ **Project Goals**
- **Automation**: Eliminate manual infrastructure provisioning and configuration.
- **Scalability**: Ensure that the infrastructure can grow with demand while maintaining efficiency.
- **Consistency**: Prevent configuration drift by managing all resources through code.
- **Version Control**: Use Git to track changes, collaborate, and roll back infrastructure if needed.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Simplify recovery by codifying infrastructure deployments.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**
- **OpenTofu**: For provisioning infrastructure.
- **Proxmox**: Managing virtual machines and containers.
- **Cloud Providers**: Integrations with Azure, AWS, or other cloud services as needed.
- **Veeam SureBackup**: For disaster recovery and backup validation.
- **Unifi Network Equipment**: Configuration as part of on-premises networking.
- **ZFS**: For reliable and performant storage management.
