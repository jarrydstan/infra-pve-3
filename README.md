# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Project

Welcome to my Infrastructure as Code (IaC) project! This repository is dedicated to converting and managing my entire infrastructure through code, enabling consistent, scalable, and version-controlled infrastructure management.

## üéØ **Project Goals**
- **Automation**: Eliminate manual infrastructure provisioning and configuration.
- **Scalability**: Ensure that the infrastructure can grow with demand while maintaining efficiency.
- **Consistency**: Prevent configuration drift by managing all resources through code.
- **Version Control**: Use Git to track changes, collaborate, and roll back infrastructure if needed.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Simplify recovery by codifying infrastructure deployments.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**
- **OpenTofu**: For provisioning infrastructure.
- **Ansible**: For configuring infrastructure.
- **Proxmox**: Managing virtual machines and containers.
- **Proxmox Backup Server**: For disaster recovery and backup validation.
- **Unifi Network Equipment**: Configuration as part of on-premises networking.
- **ZFS**: For reliable and performant storage management.
